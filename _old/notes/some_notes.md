## Welcome to the Davidverse!

### david // level 19 // code wizard

I'm David, a developer, musician, and artist from the San Francisco bay area.

I worked for three summers at Wynd, where I wrote code to scrape 6,000+ air pollutant data points in 25+ countries around the world from open online databases. I also wrote the company's Node.js style guidelines & docs galore.

When I'm not coding, drawing, or making music, you can usually find me improvising piano or playing old-school video games.

## About

```
Developer, designer, artist, musican, aspiring polymath.

I'm David. I grew up in the Bay Area of California. I'm 19 years old and develop software, design user interfaces and websites, build gadgets, draw characters, and compose music.

I worked for three summers at Wynd, where I taught myself JavaScript and wrote server code to scrape 6,000+ air pollutant data points in 25+ countries around the world from open online databases. Eventually, I wrote the company's Node.js style guidelines & docs galore.

I'm interested in _interactive media_, data science, and the intersections of computer science and music.
